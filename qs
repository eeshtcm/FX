Volatility & Skew

“How do you decide whether a change in risk reversals is flow-driven or a genuine shift in macro bias?”

“Have you seen skew shifts lately that were more about hedging demand than spot direction?”

“When short-dated vols are cheap but skew is rich, how do you think about selling gamma but keeping tail protection?”

2️⃣ Event Risk & Term Structure

“How do you approach pricing and hedging around macro events like CPI or central bank meetings — do you prefer to take that risk via outright gamma or in calendars?”

“Do you find the market systematically overprices or underprices event vol for central banks like the BoJ compared to realised moves?”

“What’s your process for spotting dislocations between short-dated and long-dated vol when there’s an event embedded?”

3️⃣ Correlation & Cross-Currency

“When you’re trading crosses like EUR/JPY, how much do you rely on pricing them from legs (EUR/USD + USD/JPY) versus trading them as their own vol surface?”

“Do you see skew in crosses as more influenced by one leg’s skew, or does cross-specific flow dominate?”

4️⃣ Hedging & Risk Management

“How do you adjust delta-hedging frequency in low-vol environments without giving away too much gamma P&L?”

“When you have a big barrier structure on the book, what’s your playbook for managing the spot-proximity risk without moving the market?”

“How do you think about correlation between spot and implied vol when sizing vega positions?”

5️⃣ Flow & Market Behaviour

“Are there client flows you think systematically create opportunities in skew or butterflies?”

“Have you noticed any patterns in how corporates vs. macro funds approach hedging in the current macro backdrop?”

“Which pairs do you think have the most ‘structural’ skew because of persistent flow rather than data or rates?”

6️⃣ Macro Integration

“How do you translate a macro rate-diff view — say, Fed vs. BoJ — into an options position that expresses it with limited premium?”

“Do you think USD/JPY downside skew is pricing more policy-risk or more geopolitical tail risk right now?”

“What’s the most interesting macro vs. vol divergence you’ve seen recently?”
