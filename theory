FX Options Theory — The Core Building Blocks
a) The Underlying in FX

In equities: underlying = 1 stock, priced in your domestic currency.

In FX: underlying = an exchange rate (Currency A / Currency B).

The “base” currency is the first in the pair (e.g., EUR in EUR/USD).

The “terms” currency is the second (e.g., USD in EUR/USD).

Important: a call option on EUR/USD = right to buy EUR and sell USD at strike 
𝐾
K.

The payoff is always in terms of the terms currency unless cash-settled otherwise.

b) FX-Specific Option Pricing — Garman–Kohlhagen Model

This extends Black-Scholes to handle two interest rates (one for each currency):

Differences from equity BS:

You discount both legs using respective rates.

Forwards are not “spot × e^{rT}” but “spot × e^{(r_d - r_f)T}”.

c) The Greeks in FX Options

FX traders think of two sets of risks:

Spot risks (delta, gamma, vega, theta)

Carry/IR risks (rho for each currency)

Delta: change in option value for 1-unit change in spot. In FX, there’s:

Spot delta: sensitivity in base currency terms.

Premium-included delta: accounts for premium in the delta notional.

Gamma: change in delta per 1-unit change in spot. Big near expiry and ATM.

Vega: change in value per 1% change in vol.

Theta: time decay; note FX theta accrues over weekends and holidays differently.

Rho_domestic: sensitivity to domestic (terms) interest rates.

Rho_foreign: sensitivity to foreign (base) interest rates.

d) The Volatility Surface

Two key dimensions:

Term structure (expiry vs vol)

Smile/Skew (delta vs vol)

Smile quoting conventions in FX:

ATM vol: typically “delta-neutral” ATM (often 50-delta strike).

Risk Reversal (RR):

Why skew exists in FX:

Persistent hedging flows (exporters/importers)

Crash risk asymmetry (e.g., CNH devaluation risk)

CB intervention bias (e.g., USD/JPY downside skew = JPY call demand)

e) Implied vs Realized Vol

Implied vol: embedded in option price from the market — forward-looking.

Realized vol: actual movement in spot — backward-looking.

In FX, desks constantly monitor IV vs RV spread to decide whether to buy/sell vol.

f) FX Options Settlement & Conventions

Settlement date often T+2 from trade date.

Expiry “cut” time matters:

NY cut (10am NY time)

Tokyo cut (3pm Tokyo)

London cut

Premium paid upfront in the terms currency.

2️⃣ Products an FX Options Desk Trades

Here’s where you need to sound fluent in both vanilla and exotics:

Vanilla Options

Calls/Puts: Basic directional bets, priced via Garman–Kohlhagen.

Straddles/Strangles: Vol bets — long = buy both legs, short = sell both legs.

Risk Reversals: Long call / short put (same delta) → expresses skew + direction.

Seagulls: Risk reversal plus short extra OTM option to fund it.

Exotic Options

Banks make a lot of P&L in structured payoffs beyond vanillas:

Barrier Options

Knock-In / Knock-Out: Activate or cancel if spot hits barrier.

E.g., USD/JPY 150 KO call: worthless if USD/JPY touches 150.

Touch / No-Touch: Pays if barrier is touched (or not).

Why barriers matter: Hedging is non-linear, can cause big spot moves near barriers (gamma hedging flows).

Digitals (Binary options)

Pays fixed amount if spot is above/below strike at expiry.

Used for event-risk bets (ECB, BoJ).

Basket / Cross Options

Options on cross rates (e.g., EUR/JPY) or baskets (weighted average of pairs).

Cliquet / Forward-Starting

Vol accrues over multiple periods; often used in structured notes.

Structured Products with FX Options Inside

Target Redemption Forwards (TRFs): Deliver enhanced forward rate until a target P&L is hit.

Dual Currency Deposits (DCDs): Deposit earning high interest if spot stays in range; otherwise delivered in alternate currency.

Accumulator/Decumulator: Buy/sell a set amount of currency periodically at favorable rates — until knockout.

3️⃣ How Desks Make Money (and Manage Risk)

Market making: Quoting bid/offer in vanillas/exotics to clients.

Position-taking: Taking vol or skew views.

Hedging: Managing Greeks dynamically, especially delta/gamma.

Arbitrage: Spot/forward arbitrage, vol-arb across tenors, skew-arb across pairs.

4️⃣ What They Might Ask You (and How to Answer)

Q: “What happens to a EUR/USD call’s value if U.S. rates rise?”
A: Higher U.S. rates (domestic rate) reduce the forward, hurting EUR calls (base currency call).

Q: “Why might USD/JPY skew be persistently negative?”
A: Because Japanese corporates hedge exports (long USD) by buying JPY calls (USD puts), creating demand for downside USD/JPY protection.

Q: “How do you hedge a long USD/JPY call position?”
A: Delta-hedge via selling USD/JPY spot or forward, adjusting hedge as spot moves (gamma hedging).

Q: “Why is the Garman–Kohlhagen model necessary in FX?”
A: FX options have two interest rates; you need to discount each currency leg separately — standard BS only has one rate.
