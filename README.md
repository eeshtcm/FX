Big picture: what moved FX in January 2025

Tariff risk re‑priced the dollar late month. Fresh U.S. tariff threats into month‑end supported the USD versus EUR/JPY as markets leaned back toward “risk‑off + U.S. exceptionalism.” 
Reuters

BoJ: a rare Jan hike. The BoJ raised its short‑term policy target to 0.50% from 0.25% on Jan 24 and kept the overnight call target “around 0.5%,” reinforcing a turn away from ultra‑easy policy and stoking JPY short‑covering episodes. The Summary of Opinions later flagged debate on weak‑yen risks and scope for more hikes.

Fed: on hold; data‑dependent. Into Jan 29 the FOMC left rates unchanged; the USD firmed late month as tariff rhetoric added to safe‑haven demand. 
Reuters

ECB: held in Jan; tone scrutinized. The Jan 29–30 meeting accounts (published Feb 27) showed a Governing Council focused on disinflation progress but cautious on the timing/pace of further cuts—keeping EUR heavy early in the year. 
European Central Bank

GBP: BoE watch. Sterling stabilized into month‑end as markets eyed the early‑February MPC after UK services inflation cooled; consensus looked for near‑term easing later in Q1/Q2. 
Reuters

China defended CNY. Authorities tightened macro‑prudential settings and used CNH bills to lean against weakness as the yuan hovered near 16‑month lows amid tariff fears. 
Reuters

Positioning vs. price: EUR/USD was near parity extremes mid‑month; the ECB’s own reference series shows EURUSD’s January low on Jan 13 (~1.02), underscoring how stretched EUR was before the late‑month USD pop. 
European Central Bank

G10 highlights (what to remember + why it mattered for options)

USD — Safe‑haven bid returned late month on tariff headlines; into CPI (Jan 14 release for Dec data) vol was better bid as traders hedged macro event risk. 
Reuters

EUR — Heavy early Jan as markets priced a cautious ECB and soft growth; the Jan meeting did not push back hard on easing expectations, keeping topside EUR vols cheap versus downside. 
European Central Bank

JPY — The Jan 24 BoJ hike to 0.50% plus language about sustained wages re‑anchored the “exit” narrative. Skews tilted toward JPY‑call demand (USDJPY downside), especially after the meeting as traders re‑hedged the risk of a sharper break lower in USD/JPY. 
Reuters
Bank of Japan

GBP — Range‑bound but sensitive to BoE pricing; services disinflation relieved the very hawkish tail. Gamma was event‑driven into early‑Feb MPC. 
Reuters

EM snapshots (good color for the desk)

TRY — CBRT cut 250bp to 45% on Jan 23, continuing December’s pivot; TRY’s path stayed headline‑ and policy‑dependent. (Follow‑ups in Feb stressed “not on autopilot.”)

MXN — Banxico’s later Q1 communications showed easing bias as growth slowed; January surveys flagged softer growth expectations—context for why MXN carry was eyed but with tariff‑risk hedges.

CNY — PBoC leaned against depreciation via macro‑prudential tweaks and CNH bill sales; the yuan’s “line in the sand” narrative was active all month.

What happened in FX options (implieds, skews, flows)

Event premium came and went. Ahead of Jan 14 U.S. CPI and Jan 24 BoJ, short‑tenor gamma was better bid; after those events, EUR and peers saw implieds bleed, while USDJPY implieds lagged the decline as BoJ risks lingered. (Early‑Feb wrap captured the tail of this Jan dynamic: one‑month EURUSD vol settled low‑8s after spiking; USDJPY 25‑d RR shifted toward JPY‑calls.)

Skew themes:

USD/JPY: persistent put‑skew for USD (i.e., JPY‑call demand) as traders hedged a drop through big figures post‑BoJ. 
TradingView

EUR/USD: downside skew (EUR puts/USD calls) richened into tariff chatter; after the event, skew eased as profit‑taking came in. 
TradingView

Macro overlays: Several houses warned of higher FX vol in 2025 vs recent years—useful framing if they ask “why vols didn’t collapse post‑events.”

How to talk about this like an options trader

Vol supply vs demand: “Into CPI/BoJ, we saw front‑end gamma demand, but post‑events vols compressed unevenly—EUR vols bled faster than USDJPY, where policy‑path uncertainty kept downside skew supported.” 
TradingView
+1

Skew as policy hedge: “We preferred USDJPY downside (JPY‑call) structures as a cheap hedge against a BoJ follow‑through and lower U.S.–JP rate‑diffs.” 
TradingView

EUR topside vs parity risk: “With EURUSD near 1.02 mid‑Jan, downside was crowded; selectively buying EUR topside call spreads into any ECB pushback made sense once positioning looked one‑way.” 
European Central Bank

Tariff tail‑risk: “Late‑Jan tariff headlines supported USD and downside skew in cyclical FX; we liked calendar put spreads (front‑end protection that rolls into known policy/event risk).” 
Reuters

EM carry with insurance: “TRY cuts and MXN growth downgrades argued for carry with collars—sell limited topside to fund downside USD calls.” 
tcmb.gov.tr
banxico.org.mx

Trade structure examples (interview‑friendly)

USD/JPY downside hedge: Buy 1–2M 25‑delta JPY calls vs selling 10–15d wings (risk‑reversal or seagull) to express BoJ follow‑through; choose post‑BoJ expiries to keep gamma where policy risk lives. 
TradingView

EUR/USD mean‑reversion: After the Jan 13 extreme, 2M EUR call spreads (e.g., 1.06/1.09 equivalents at the time) to fade parity‑adjacent stress while capping premium outlay; add downside put as collar if you need theta cover. 
European Central Bank

Tariff risk overlay: Front‑month USD calls vs beta FX (AUD, KRW, MXN) as event hedges; roll via calendars if tariff path drips out in headlines. 
Reuters

Crisp one‑liners you can use

“January was about policy asymmetry and tariff tails: BoJ’s hike kept USDJPY downside skew bid, while late‑month tariff risk re‑underpinned the dollar.” 
Reuters
+1

“EUR was stretched near 1.02 on Jan 13—great place to think about topsides, not fresh downside.” 
European Central Bank

“China leaned harder on CNY stability tools—macro‑prudential tweaks and CNH bills—limiting CNH vol spikes despite tariff noise.” 
Reuters

“TRY’s January cut to 45% kept EM carry interesting but headline‑sensitive—carry with collars, not naked.”

Thought for 17s

Perfect—here’s a month‑by‑month FX brief for 2025 year‑to‑date (Jan → mid‑Aug) tuned for an FX options desk interview: what moved spot, what central banks did, and the clean vol/skew angles you can talk to.

January 2025 — “Strong‑USD start, China defends CNY, BoJ risk on the radar”

USD opened the year at 2‑yr highs on growth/“higher for longer” expectations in the U.S. (first trading day of 2025). 
Reuters

China stepped up support for the yuan (macro‑prudential tweaks; more dollars in HK; messaging to steady CNY) as depreciation pressure built. That contained front‑end CNH vol spikes. 
Reuters

Markets priced a BoJ hike risk into late Jan, with JPY shorts trimming; inauguration‑day flow saw the USD drift lower into U.S. policy headlines. (Good color if they ask about USDJPY skew behavior.) 
Reuters

Options take: Front‑end gamma was better bid around U.S. data and Japan risk; USDJPY 25d RR leaned to JPY‑call protection as “BoJ normalization” remained the hedge of choice.

February — “ECB easing path priced; JPY strongest in G10 on BoJ expectations”

EUR slid into month‑end as markets leaned toward further ECB cuts on soft inflation/growth; JPY outperformed on expectations BoJ would hike in 2025 even though USDJPY was choppy day‑to‑day. 
Reuters
+1

China credit pulse: January lending data (printed mid‑Feb) hit a fresh record—macro support that helped cap CNH downside. 
Reuters

Options take: In G10, EUR downside skew richened; in USDJPY, persistent JPY‑call demand as policy asymmetry themes built.

March — “ECB cut; BoJ steady at 0.50%; tariffs dominate risk‑talk”

ECB cut 25bp (to ~2.50% deposit) and signaled scope for more; EUR bounced initially on “sell the rumor, buy the fact,” but the policy path stayed dovish. 
Reuters
+1

BoJ held at ~0.50% (post‑2024 normalization), citing trade‑tariff uncertainty clouding the outlook—kept USDJPY sensitive to U.S.–JP rate‑diffs and risk tone. 
Reuters

Options take: Event premia (ECB/BoJ) lifted short‑tenor gamma. Post‑events, EUR vols bled faster than USDJPY as Japan policy‑path uncertainty lingered in USDJPY downside skew.

April — “Dollar slump month”

USD had its biggest monthly drop since 2022 (down ~4½% in Apr) as investors rotated out of U.S. assets and leaned into the global soft‑landing + ECB easing narrative. Great month to cite if they ask “when did USD downside really accelerate?” 
Reuters

Mixed U.S. data (growth wobble headlines into end‑Apr) added to dollar selling pressure. 
Reuters

Options take: Broad USD‑put demand showed up in risk‑reversals across EUR, GBP, AUD; EUR topside call spreads priced better after April’s break.

May — “Tariff uncertainty = choppy USD; policymakers wary of ‘weaponizing FX’”

Market tone swung with U.S. trade/tariff headlines; policymakers (esp. in Asia) were cautious about overt FX responses—kept beta‑FX direction choppy and calendar vol interesting. 
Reuters

Options take: Good month to use calendar put spreads on high‑beta FX vs USD (roll the hedge as headlines drip), and to keep AUD/KRW/MXN USD‑call hedges funded.

June — “Fed on hold; options market leans into further USD weakness”

Fed kept rates at 4.25%–4.50%, dots still penciling two 2025 cuts but with higher inflation projections given tariff pass‑through risk. (Strong interview ammo.) 
Reuters
+1

FX options positioning tilted toward more USD weakness, even as spot steadied—use this to talk about positioning vs price action. 
Reuters

Options take: EUR upside (call spreads) and USD puts vs G10 were favored; USDMXN collars popular to keep carry while owning tail‑risk.

July — “First USD up‑month of 2025; ECB pauses; USDJPY back on the front foot”

Dollar logged its first monthly gain of 2025 (~+5% on DXY‑style measures) as trade tensions eased and U.S. data looked resilient; USDJPY rallied toward late‑May highs. 
Reuters
+1

ECB held at ~2% after a year of cuts, citing tariff uncertainty—neutral for EUR, with the market rotating to data‑dependence. 
Reuters

Options take: EURUSD topside demand faded; USDJPY topside (USD calls/JPY puts) saw buyers on momentum, but desks still liked cheap JPY‑call tails into future BoJ risk.

August (to mid‑month) — “Markets waiting on U.S. CPI & geopolitics; USD steady”

Into Aug CPI, macro sat in “wait mode”: USD and USTs watched for cut‑timing signals; sentiment toggled with geopolitics/trade. 
Reuters

Broader risk tone mixed; equities near highs, but bid for data‑event protection persisted. 
Reuters

Options take: Short‑tenor gamma pops around CPI remain a theme; with summer liquidity, dispersion across G10 vols helps relative‑value (e.g., long USDJPY downside skew vs short EURUSD skew).

EM color you can drop in (when they ask beyond G10)

Turkey: Aggressive easing across EM resumed by mid‑year (Turkey among the larger cutters), shaping TRY carry with protection as the default stance. 
Reuters

India: RBI stayed active in spot + NDF to stabilize INR amid tariff noise (good example of two‑handed intervention mechanics). 
Reuters

Ready‑made one‑liners (sound like the desk)

“H1 was USD down / April capitulation; July flipped it on better U.S. data and trade de‑escalation—so vols stayed event‑driven, not trending.” 
Reuters
+1

“ECB’s March cut, June hint‑at‑pause, July hold kept EUR a data‑beta; the cleaner macro skew was JPY—own USDJPY downside via JPY calls against BoJ‑path risk.” 
Reuters
+1

“By June, options markets were positioned for more USD weakness even as spot went sideways—great example of vol vs spot divergence.” 
Reuters

Trade structure templates (you can tailor to the current level)

USDJPY tail hedge: Buy 1–2M 25d JPY calls vs selling 10d wings (seagull). Rationale: cheap convexity to BoJ or U.S. data downside; keep vega light at the front.

EURUSD mean‑reversion: In months where EUR is stretched (April), 2–3M call spreads (cap premium) with an OTM put as a collar if you want theta help. 
Reuters

Carry‑with‑insurance (MXN/TRY): Zero‑cost collars: long local‑carry, fund USD call (EM put) via topside calls you’re happy to sell on spot rallies. 
Reuters

If you tell me which pairs the interview will likely focus on (EURUSD, USDJPY, GBPUSD, USDCNH, USDMXN/TRY), I’ll spit out 30‑second, desk‑style answers per pair—spot drivers, current skew setup, and a trade you’d run with today.

do a very highly detailed overview for august specifically so i can talk about it

Thought for 1m 36s

awesome — here’s a desk-ready, highly detailed August (through Fri, 15 Aug, London) FX rundown you can talk to in an interview. I’ve grouped it by what actually moved markets, then drilled down by G10/EM and the options angles you’ll probably get quizzed on.

August FX: what’s driving it (so far)

1) U.S. disinflation vs. “sticky” pipelines → whipsaw in USD cuts pricing.

CPI (Jul) came in benign on headline (+0.2% m/m; 2.7% y/y), but core re‑accelerated to +0.3% m/m; 3.1% y/y (largest since Jan) → markets leaned back toward a September cut, but smaller/bumpier path. 
Reuters
+1

PPI (Jul) then surprised hot (+0.9% m/m; 3.3% y/y), snuffing talk of a 50bp cut, trimming odds of even 25bp → USD steadied and UST yields firmed. Powell’s Jackson Hole remarks (late Aug) now matter more. 
Reuters

2) UK: BoE cuts but sounds split → GBP pops.

BoE -25bp to 4.00% (5–4 split, first time needing two votes); GBP firmed on the “reluctant cut” vibe; the message: easing cycle shallow, data‑dependent. 
Bank of England
Reuters

UK Q2 GDP beat (0.3% q/q) added a small tailwind to sterling into mid‑month. 
The Guardian

3) Euro area: inflation on target, growth mixed → ECB seen on hold into autumn.

EZ HICP (Jul) at 2.0% headline / 2.3% core, steady; markets push out further cuts; “higher‑for‑longer” chatter picked up. Industrial production (Jun) slipped ‑1.3% m/m. 
Reuters
European Commission

4) Japan: macro turn helping JPY at the margin.

Q2 GDP +1.0% saar beat; combined with creeping BoJ‑hike expectations into Q4 keeps intervention chatter alive if USD/JPY sprints higher again. Finance Minister flagged “alarm” at FX moves on Aug 1. 
Reuters

5) China weakness weighs on China‑linked FX (and supports USD on risk).

New yuan loans (Jul) contracted for the first time in ~20 years; activity data (IP/retail sales) softened → CNH heavy, commodity FX sensitive. 
Reuters
+1

6) Commodities & rates mix: oil drifted near multi‑month lows into mid‑Aug, then steadied; CAD and NOK traded the U.S. inflation swings plus local policy color (Norges hold). 
Reuters
+1

G10 quick hits (levels/themes you can quote)

USD (broad): The dovish‑then-less‑dovish sequence (CPI soft → PPI hot) left the dollar softer into Aug 13, then steadier Aug 14–15, as markets walked back 50bp and trimmed 25bp probabilities for Sep. Watch Jackson Hole guidance. 
Reuters
+1

EUR: Supported by on‑target inflation and fading ECB‑cut bets; macro is mixed (German output weak, EZ IP down m/m). Near‑term euro magnets came from chunky expiries around 1.17 on Aug 14. 
Reuters
+1
European Commission
eFXdata

GBP: BoE’s 25bp cut with a hawkish split and firmer Q2 GDP let GBP outperform early/mid‑Aug; sterling extended gains as markets priced a shallower UK path than the Fed. 
Reuters
+1
The Guardian

JPY: USD/JPY bounced around 147–149: early‑Aug jawboning from MoF, then Q2 GDP beat and growing odds of a BoJ hike by Oct/Dec underpin the downside‑USD/JPY narrative, but Fed path still dominates day‑to‑day. 
Reuters

AUD/NZD:

RBA cut 25bp to 3.60% on Aug 12 (two‑year low cash rate), signaled it can ease again; AUD traded the global USD swings + China data. 
Reuters
+1

RBNZ widely expected to cut 25bp to 3.00% on Aug 20; labour softer and CPI inside band. NZD underperformed on the policy setup. 
Reuters

CAD: Loonie softened on hot U.S. PPI (USD/CAD to 1.38s) after holding up earlier in the week; local jobs were weak and oil hasn’t provided much cushion. 
Reuters
+1

NOK: Norges Bank held 4.25% (Aug 14), flagging cuts later this year; NOK firmed modestly post‑decision but still trades oil/Euro beta. 
Reuters

EM highlights

MXN: Banxico -25bp to 7.75% (Aug 7) in a divided vote; easing cycle continues but slower pace. Peso tracked global USD impulses rather than tanking. 
Reuters
media.marketnews.com

INR: RBI actively defended 87.95 record‑low area in spot and NDF, keeping INR contained despite tariff noise; 1‑month USD/INR IV ~4.35% (low for Aug), options pricing neutralized directional skew.

TRY: Macro backdrop remains in a gradual‑easing narrative post‑July cut; drip‑feed positives on KKM wind‑down continue.

Options market — what changed in August (and what didn’t)

Vol generally compressed into Aug CPI, then stabilized after hot PPI.

USD/JPY 1‑month IV fell to ~8.5 on Aug 13 (near 1‑yr lows), tracking realized vol; the whole 1–12m curve sat at 1‑yr lows before firming a touch post‑PPI. Theme: range‑trading + macro data “not disruptive enough… yet.” 
eFXdata

EURUSD risk reversals remain skewed to EUR calls over puts on multi‑tenor measures (3m/6m/1y near record‑bullishness back in June; the skew stayed positive into August). Translation: topside EUR protection remains more expensive than downside. 
Reuters

Big expiries helped pin spot: e.g., EURUSD 1.1700 ~€5.5bn on Aug 14; notable GBP strikes too — classic “gamma magnets” day. 
eFXdata

Asia vols: USD/INR IVs stayed subdued (~4.35% 1‑mth) with RBI capping tails; USD/CNH options activity remains heavy but low‑vol (1‑mth IV around the lows) as authorities anchor CNY. 
Reuters
+1

Positioning & hedging color you can mention:

Corporates and macro funds have kept EUR topside hedges (calls/call‑spreads) live; U.S. corporates re‑upped EUR puts in July as a dollar bounce risk hedge; both narratives still visible in August flows. 
Reuters

Street remains wary of USD/JPY downside risk later in 2025 if BoJ hikes land — even as near‑term IV is cheap. (Analyst/flow pieces continue to flag this asymmetry.) 
Reuters

China spillovers (why AUD, KRW, CNH underperformed on bad days)

Credit impulse shock: new yuan loans (Jul) shrank vs. seasonal growth → weak private demand signal. 
Reuters

Activity data: IP/retail sales (Jul) disappointed, reinforcing the soft‑growth narrative. 
Reuters

PBoC continues to lean via fixings and bill tools to manage currency expectations; CNH vols stayed contained. 
Reuters

Geopolitics/policy watch (why traders kept event‑risk premium light until PPI)

White House tariffs and data‑credibility noise kept the dollar path messy; a Trump–Putin summit (Alaska) raised weekend risk but FX vols didn’t blow out. 
Reuters
+1

Fed personnel speculation and public commentary (e.g., Bessent), plus Jackson Hole later this month, kept front‑end rates/FX reactive to headlines. 
Reuters
+1

What I’d say on the options desk (talking points)

“U.S. CPI was benign, but PPI reminded us the pipeline isn’t clean — that killed 50bp and steadied USD into the weekend.” 
Reuters
+1

“GBP rallied on a reluctant BoE cut (5–4). The split and guidance argue for a shallow UK path — supportive for GBP on crosses.” 
Reuters

“Euro’s supported by on‑target HICP and fewer ECB cuts priced; Eurostat IP miss caps enthusiasm.” 
Reuters
European Commission

“Japan’s Q2 growth beat plus hike odds later in 2025 cap USD/JPY; but with U.S. data in the driver’s seat, spot’s range‑bound unless we get a shock.” 
Reuters
+1

“Vol: USD/JPY 1‑mth IV printed ~8.5 — near 1‑yr lows — before PPI. Cheap gamma made expiries matter: EURUSD 1.17 strikes pinned price action on the 14th.” 
eFXdata
eFXdata

“China softness (loans contraction + weak activity) is the key headwind for AUD/NZD and CNH; RBA cut added to AUD’s drag.” 
Reuters

“EM: Banxico slowed to −25; INR stable on RBI defense — options show 1‑mth IV ~4.35% and no skew.” 
Reuters

Near‑term calendar (the “what’s next” the interviewer will expect)

U.S. Retail Sales (Fri, 15 Aug) sets the tone into Jackson Hole (late Aug) — any consumption wobble plus stable CPI keeps 25bp alive; if strong, the Fed may signal more patience. 
Barron's
Reuters

RBNZ (Wed, 20 Aug) — consensus −25bp to 3.00%
